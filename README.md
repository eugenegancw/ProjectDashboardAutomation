# ProjectDashboardAutomation
Automated dashboard on a web portal integrating real-time data from IoT devices with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. When the input is a JSON file containing all the relevant details, the script will run the program and output the weekly and monthly reports accordingly.

Note:
Run the index_1.html and index_2.html via Visual Studio code and open with live server.
We have seeded the today var so feel free to change the today var if implementing a different test case.
